# 🛡️ Infosec University Hackathon – CTF Writeups

This repository contains my **personal writeups** for challenges from the  
**Infosec University Hackathon (Virtual CTF)** organised by **Synchrony** in collaboration with **CCoE (DSCI & Govt. of Telangana)**.

The challenges covered multiple cybersecurity domains and tested both **technical depth and analytical thinking**.  
Most challenges were successfully solved and documented here for **learning and knowledge sharing**.

## 📌 Important Note

- ❌ **AI/ML 02 – Cerberus** was **not solved** during the CTF.
- All other listed challenges were solved and have corresponding writeups.
- This repository reflects **real progress**, not perfection.
